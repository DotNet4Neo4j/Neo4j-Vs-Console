### Stable [![neo4jclient-tx MyGet Build Status](https://www.myget.org/BuildSource/Badge/neo4jclient-tx?identifier=57c22856-7609-4211-a432-a1ecdf6f1497)](https://www.myget.org/)

#### Breaking Changes in 1.1 

* `CollectAs` now returns `IEnumerable<T>` and not `IEnumerable<Node<T>>`
* `IHttpClient` now contains a `Username` and `Password` getter, this should have an effect if you're using a custom ``HttpClient`` for Authentication. You no longer need to use a custom HttpClient, the `GraphClient` supports authentication now.
